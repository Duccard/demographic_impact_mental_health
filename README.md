# Demographic Impact on the Mental Health of Employees

This project explores the impact of demographic factors on mental health conditions among employees in the technology sector, using survey data collected over multiple years. It focuses on understanding how mental health conditions are distributed across different age groups, genders, and geographic locations, and how workplace stigma influences diagnosed individuals.

## The analysis answers key questions such as:

1. How common are mental health disorders among tech employees?
2. Is there a negative stigma in workplaces toward mental health issues?
3. Do location and demographics can (gender, age) influence the prevalence or type of mental health conditions?
